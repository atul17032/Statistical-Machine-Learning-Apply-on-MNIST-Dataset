# Standard-method-apply-on-MNIST-data

 Use the MNIST digit recognition dataset having 10 classes for the purpose of this code from this link
 [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
 
 # DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION
 perfrom some task
 
 a. Compute the global mean and covariance of the data.
 b. Implement PCA and FDA from scratch.
 c. Visualize data using a scatter plot after applying PCA & FDA. (You can
 transform the data into 2 dimensions and then plot it.)
 d. Implement the LDA discriminant function from scratch.
 e. Apply PCA with 95% eigen energy on MNIST and then LDA for classification
 and report the accuracy on test data.
 f. Visualize and analyze the eigenvectors obtained using PCA (only for
 eigenvectors obtained in part(e). I.e., Display eigenvectors by converting
 them into image form).
 g. Perform step(e) with different eigen energy mentioned below and show the
 comparisons and analysis on accuracy.

  ● 70% eigen energy
  ● 90% eigen energy
  ● 99% eigen energy
 h. Apply FDA on MNIST and then LDA for classification and report the accuracy
 on test data.
 i. Perform PCA then FDA. Classify the transformed datasets using LDA.
 Analyze the results on Accuracy.
